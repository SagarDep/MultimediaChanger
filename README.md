# MultimediaChanger

This is a experimental app which perform basic function
Speed of operation depends on cpu
I provide one main Feature to merge video and audio by removing existing video sound
Before merging you can perform extrra manupulation on audio i.e you make audio faast or slow.

Known issue:
It may not support some audio and video format since I didnot test for all formats.
It suppor API level 16 i.e. kitkat to lolipop I only test on KitKat 4.4.
