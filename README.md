This is a experimental app which perform basic function
Speed of operation depends on cpu

Before merging you can perform extra manupulation on audio i.e you make audio faast or slow.

Now you caN PERFORM Various operation on video.These operation may take long time its depends on type of video and duration. for example to make video slow or fast it take more time.
